                    the Site. Payments must be made monthly in advance unless otherwise mutually
                    agreed upon. All payment obligations are non-cancellable and all amounts paid
                    are non-refundable. You must provide Chocolate Kiwi Limited with a valid credit
                    card or valid online payment account information as a condition to registering
                    for the Service. Chocolate Kiwi Limited reserves the right to modify its fees
                    and charges and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least thirty (30)

                  <h4>Billing and Renewal</h4>
                  <p>
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited charges and collects in advance for use of the Service.
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited will automatically renew and bill your credit card or
                    online payment account each month. The renewal charge will be equal to the
                    License Fee in effect during the prior month, unless Chocolate Kiwi Limited has
                    given you at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of a fee increase,
                    which shall be effective upon renewal and thereafter. Any amounts not paid when
                    due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per
                    month, or the maximum legal rate, if less. Chocolate Kiwi Limited shall be
                    entitled to withhold performance and discontinue Service until all amounts due
                    are paid in full. Chocolate Kiwi Limited’s fees are exclusive of all taxes,
                    levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for
                    payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only taxes based solely
                    on Chocolate Kiwi Limited’s income. You agree to provide Chocolate Kiwi Limited
                    with complete and accurate billing and contact information. This information
                    includes your legal company name, street address, e-mail address and name and
                    telephone number of an authorised billing contact and Alpaca Administrator. You
                    agree to update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it. If
                    the contact information you have provided is false or fraudulent, Chocolate Kiwi
                    Limited may terminate your access to the Service in addition to any other legal
                    remedies.

                  <h4>Named Groups (Herd, Flock or Other Group Name)</h4>
                  <p>
                    You are responsible for paying for the number of Named Groups designated in your
                    account, whether or not the Named Group uses the Services. You may add Named
                    Groups by designating the number of Named Groups you desire in your account.
                    Added Named Groups will be subject to the following: (a) the fee applicable to
                    Named Groups after such addition will be the then-current fee set forth on the
                    Site applicable to the total number of Named Groups designated in your account
                    and (b) any increase to the fees as a result of the addition of a Named Group in
                    the middle of a billing month will be charged in full for that billing month.
                    You may transfer a Named Group license to another User, provided that you may
                    not exceed the number of Named Groups for which you have paid the applicable
                    License Fees. You acknowledge that if you have been designated as a Named User
                    by another User (“Paying User”), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
                    this Agreement, Chocolate Kiwi Limited shall be entitled to withhold performance
                    and discontinue Service to you until all amounts due on your account (including,
                    but not limited to, your License Fee) are paid in full.

                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited reserves the right to establish capacity limits on your
                    storage of Customer Content on the Service. Chocolate Kiwi Limited shall provide
                    logical and physical security to ensure the logical and physical security of its
                    equipment and Customer Content. The logical and physical security provided by
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited will include, but not be limited to (a) a defined
                    security administration practice and process including account and password

                    You represent and warrant that you shall keep and maintain your own copy of all
                    Alpaca Content that is provided to the Service and Chocolate Kiwi Limited.
                    Except as set forth below, Chocolate Kiwi Limited is not obligated to back up
                    any Alpaca Content that is posted on the Service. Chocolate Kiwi Limited
                    therefore recommends that you create backup copies of any Alpaca Content posted
                    on the Service at your sole cost and expense. You agree that any use of the
                    Service contrary to or in violation of your representations and warranties in
                    this section constitutes improper and unauthorised use of the Service. You agree

                    Limited’s sole discretion, remove or modify any Alpaca Content which it deems to
                    violate your representations and warranties in this section. In the event of a
                    loss of Alpaca Content caused by Chocolate Kiwi Limited, Chocolate Kiwi Limited
                    will use commercially reasonable efforts to recover the Alpaca Content within
                    ninety-six (96) hours of notification of loss. If Chocolate Kiwi Limited
                    performs recovery services for a loss of Customer Content not caused by
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited, you agree to pay Chocolate Kiwi Limited’s then-current
                    time and materials rate to attempt to recover the Alpaca Content. The foregoing
                    constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy for any loss of Customer Content.

                    your breach), Chocolate Kiwi Limited will make available to you a file of the
                    Alpaca Content if requested in writing by you within thirty (30) days after such
                    termination. You agree and acknowledge that Chocolate Kiwi Limited has no
                    obligation to retain the Alpaca Content, and may delete such Alpaca Content, at
                    any time on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following termination.
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited reserves the right to withhold, remove and/or discard
                    Alpaca Content, without notice, for any breach, including, without limitation,
                    your non-payment. Upon termination for cause, your right to access or use Alpaca
                    Content shall immediately cease, and Chocolate Kiwi Limited will have no
                    obligation to maintain or provide any Alpaca Content.

                  <p>
                    The parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this section
                    shall survive and continue in full force and effect despite any failure of
                    consideration or of an exclusive remedy. The parties acknowledge that the prices
                    have been set and the Terms entered into in reliance upon these limitations of
                    liability and that all such limitations form an essential basis of the bargain
                    between the parties.

                  <h4>Termination by Chocolate Kiwi Limited</h4>
                  <p>
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited may at any time terminate these Terms if (a) you or any
                    of your Named Users have breached any provision of these Terms (or have acted in
                    a manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with
                    these Terms); (b) Chocolate Kiwi Limited is required to do so by law (for
                    example, where the provision of the Site or Service to you is, or becomes,
                    unlawful); (c) the provision of the Service to you by Chocolate Kiwi Limited is,
                    in Chocolate Kiwi Limited’s opinion, no longer commercially viable; or (d)
                    Chocolate Kiwi Limited has elected to discontinue the Site or the Service (or
                    any part thereof).

                  <p>
                    Termination of your account includes: (a) removal of access to all offerings
                    within the Service; (b) deletion of your password and all related information;
                    and (c) barring of further use of the Service. Upon expiration or termination,
                    you shall promptly discontinue use of the Site and the Service. However,
                    Sections 5.6 (IP Ownership), 6 (Payment), 7.1 (License; Warranty), 7.4 (Content

                  <p>
                    The parties acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Section 5
                    (License Grant and Restrictions) will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to
                    the non-breaching party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate
                    remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach. If
                    any legal action is brought to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be
                    entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection
                    expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive.

                    You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms,
                    or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written
                    consent of Chocolate Kiwi Limited, and any attempted assignment, subcontract,
                    delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void;
                    provided, however, that you may assign these Terms in connection with a merger,
                    acquisition, reorganisation or sale of all or substantially all of you assets,
                    or other operation of law, without any consent of Chocolate Kiwi Limited. These
                    Terms shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and
                    permitted assigns.

                    (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these
                    Terms if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire,
                    earthquake, flood, or any other event beyond the control of such party, provided
                    that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the
                    other party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as
                    possible.
