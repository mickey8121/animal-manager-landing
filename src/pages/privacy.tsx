                We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit the Website,
                when you send us information or communications, and/or when you use the Service.
                “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you,
                including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as
                well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked
                to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated
                with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the
                identification of an individual person. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data
                as described below.

                  <p>
                    We collect Personal Data from you, including first and last name, e-mail
                    address, and password, when you create an account to log in to the Service. We
                    also retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you
                    store using your account on the Service. If you provide us with feedback or
                    contact us via e-mail, for example with a technical support request or in
                    response to an employment opportunity posted on the Website, we will collect
                    your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the

                    submit to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we
                    may collect additional information about you. When you post messages in the chat
                    rooms on the Service, the information contained in your posting will be stored

                  <p>
                    To make the Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a
                    third party service provider) collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you,
                    including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a
                    number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the
                    Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a
                    date/time stamp for your visit. We also use Cookies (as defined below) and
                    navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information
                    regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for
                    which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we
                    automatically gather this Personal Data and Anonymous Data and store it in log
                    files each time you visit our Website or access your account on the Service.
                    “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your
                    computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session
                    Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies
                    (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
                    personal and interactive experience on the Service. Persistent Cookies can be
                    removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
                    disable Cookies, some areas of the Service may not work properly.

                    navigation of the Website. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous
                    Data to Third Party Companies in our discretion. However, while this information
                    will not identify you personally, in some instances these Third Party Companies
                    may be able to combine this aggregate information with other data they have
                    about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them
                    to identify you personally.

                    transferred Personal Data will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any

                The Company is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a

                notice of the changes on our Website. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy
